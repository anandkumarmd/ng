Compiler  (binds DOM w/ scope; make it live/interactive)
--------
Compiler is an angular service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. 
The compilation process happens into two phases.

1)Compile: traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. 
The result is a linking function.

2)Link: combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. 
Any changes in the scope model are reflected in the view, 
and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model. 
Making the scope model a single source of truth.

ng-repeat
--------
Some directives such ng-repeat 'clone' DOM elements once for each item in collection. 
Having a compile and link phase improves performance since the cloned template only needs to be compiled once, 
and then linked once for each clone instance.
