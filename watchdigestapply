What is $digest?
----------------
At it's core, the important thing to know about $digest is that it loops through all watchers
on the scope it was called on and it's child scopes. and evaluates them to see if they've changed, 
executing their handlers if they have.

What is $apply?
==============
Simply put, it's a wrapper around $rootScope.$digest that evaluates any expression passed to it prior to calling $digest().
That's it.  So, if you're calling it by itself without passing an argument to it, you may as well just call $digest().
