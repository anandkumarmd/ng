4 types of scopes:

1.normal prototypal scope inheritance -- 
ng-include, ng-switch, ng-controller, directive with scope: true

2.normal prototypal scope inheritance with a [ copy/assignment ] -- 
Each iteration of ng-repeat creates a new child scope, and that new child scope always gets a new property.
ng-repeat. 

3.isolate scope -- directive with scope: {...}. 
This one is not prototypal, but '=', '@', and '&' provide a mechanism to access parent scope properties, via attributes.
Text Binding (Prefix: @)
One-way Binding (Prefix: &)
Two-way Binding (Prefix: =)

4.transcluded scope -- directive with transclude: true. 
This one is also normal prototypal scope inheritance, but it is also a sibling of any isolate scope.
