Bootstrap has 3 parts: 
    css, 
    icons 
    javascript file ( needs JQuery)
javascript file that has the more complicated controls (like popoups, dropdowns, etc)
angular-ui-bootstrap angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap rewrites the javascript as angular directives but 
retains the original css and icons and does not include those files in its ditsribution
